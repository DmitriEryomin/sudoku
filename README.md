# Sudoku
Sudoku is a popular and engaging number puzzle game that challenges players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids, known as "regions" or "boxes," contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with some cells pre-filled with numbers, strategically placed to ensure that there is only one solution to the puzzle. The objective of Sudoku is to logically deduce and systematically fill in the remaining cells, adhering to the rules and restrictions of the game.
